kwin(32117) KWin::GlxBackend::present: 
It seems you are using the nvidia driver without triple buffering
You must export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP" to prevent large CPU overhead on synced swaps
Preferably, enable the TripleBuffer Option in the xorg.conf Device
For this reason, the tearing prevention has been disabled.
